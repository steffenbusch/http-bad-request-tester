# Simple HTTP Bad Request Testing Utility

## Description

This utility is a Bash script designed to automate the process of testing HTTP bad requests against a given host. It's useful for quickly performing a series of tests based on predefined `.txt` test case files.

## Features

- Easily specify the host to test against
- Specify custom port (default is 80)
- Supports wildcards for specifying multiple test cases
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Supports disabling color output

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0 or later
- Ncat version of `nc` from the Nmap project

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/steffenbusch/http-bad-request-tester
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    cd http-bad-request-tester
    ```

3. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```

4. Fix one testcase:

    ```bash
    echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\n\n" > mixed-line-endings.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To test against a specific host:

```bash
./run.sh --host arm.stbu.net
```

To test against a specific host and port:

```bash
./run.sh --host arm.stbu.net --port 8080
```

To specify a single test case:

```bash
./run.sh --host arm.stbu.net --testcases good-request.txt
```

To specify multiple test cases using wildcards:

```bash
./run.sh --host arm.stbu.net --testcases "http0.9*"
```

## About the Test Cases

The test cases included in this utility vary in their adherence to HTTP protocol specifications. These test cases have been generated with the assistance of ChatGPT and cover a broad spectrum of request scenarios.

**Note:** Not all the test cases represent "bad" or "malformed" requests according to the HTTP specifications. Some may be fully compliant requests, while others deliberately deviate from the standard to test how the server handles such cases.

Please read through the test cases to understand their specifics before running them.

## Help

For the usage guide:

```bash
./run.sh --help
```

## Disabling Color Output

To disable color output, set the NO_COLOR environment variable:

```bash
NO_COLOR=true ./run.sh --host arm.stbu.net
```

This utility is intended for educational and ethical testing purposes only. **Only run it against hosts you own or have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
